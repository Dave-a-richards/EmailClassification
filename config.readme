This configuration file is configured to put passwords into the system keychain using the keyring library.
This keeps passwords from being stored in the flat file.
To change a password, symply replace the Stored In Keyring value with the new password and it will update

Limitations:
At this time, it will only handle username/password combinations that are one level deep in the config.yaml
